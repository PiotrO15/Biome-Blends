## ðŸ“– Introduction

**Biome Blends** is a mod that lets you apply a specific biome to a targeted location using **blends**. By default, it provides blends for all the vanilla biomes, but you can also define your own blends using data packs.

## ðŸŽ¨ Custom Blend Capabilities

While the default blends are basic, the data pack format supports extensive customization, which includes:
- Restricting usage by biome, dimension, or namespace
- Defining vertical and horizontal range of effect
- Specifying a remainder item after use
- Custom sounds and particles when applying the blend
- Assigning a biome namespace instead of a specific biome

If the existing system doesnâ€™t support your use case, make sure to open an issue on Github or to join the Discord and share your suggestions!

## âœ¨ Creating a Custom Blend

### Prerequisites

Creating custom blends requires both data and resource packs. Before you begin, make sure you have:
- Text editor with JSON highlighting, such as Visual Studio Code
- Basic understanding of the JSON syntax
- Basic knowledge of [data pack](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Data_pack) and [resource pack](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Resource_pack) formats

### Getting Started

Creating a custom blend includes the following three elements:
1. [Blend definition](./custom-blends/datapack-format) (data pack), which specifies your blend's behavior.
2. [Blend assets](./custom-blends/resourcepack-format) (resource pack): the model and the translated name of the blend.
3. Recipe (data pack), which will be used to obtain the blend.
