# Blend Recipes

The blends you add aren't actually new items. Instead, blend type is stored in a data component.

<Callout variant="warning">
    Recipes for inexistent blends will still work and display in recipe viewers. By default, these will use a bland blend texture.

## Simple Shapeless Blend Recipe

Blend recipes use a `components` object to set `biomeblends:blend_type` to the right blend type.

The following recipe uses a bland blend and a dirt block and creates a plains blend as a result.
```json
{
  "type": "minecraft:crafting_shapeless",
  "category": "misc",
  "ingredients": [
    {
      "item": "minecraft:dirt"
    },
    {
      "item": "biomeblends:biome_blend"
    }
  ],
  "result": {
    "components": {
      "biomeblends:blend_type": "minecraft:plains"
    },
    "count": 1,
    "id": "biomeblends:biome_blend"
  }
}
```
