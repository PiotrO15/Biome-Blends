# Mod Configuration

The `biomeblends-common.toml` config allows global changes to blend behavior, which can be useful for both players and modpack creators. This can be useful for simpler changes without the need to edit or create data packs.s

## Blend Radius Scale

The blend radius can be modified using the following two config options: 

- `horizontal_scale` 
- `vertical_scale` 

These act as **multipliers** on the radius values defined in the data pack. They preserve the relative differences between blend types (e.g. larger blends stay larger than smaller ones).

Blend Scale supports values from 0.0 to 10.0. For example, setting `horizontal_scale` to `0.5` will cut the area of effect of all blends by half.

## Ignore Vertical Radius

`ignore_vertical_radius` can be set to `true` to apply all blends from **the bottom to the top of the world**, ignoring any vertical radius settings.
