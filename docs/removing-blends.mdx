# Removing Default Blends

The default biome blends may not suit your modpack. Luckily, any blend can be removed using a data pack. Additionally, a mod like KubeJS can be used to simplify data pack loading.

## Using `pack.mcmeta` Filters 
You can disable any blends using the `filter` block in your `pack.mcmeta` file.

### Removing Specific Blends
To remove individual blends (e.g. *the_end* and *the_void*), add the following to your `pack.mcmeta`:
```json
  "filter": {
    "block": [
      {
        "path": ".*blend_type/the_void"
      },
      {
        "path": ".*blend_type/the_end"
      }
    ]
  }
```
This will block the specified biome blends from loading.

<Callout variant="warning">
    Blend recipes must be removed separately. If not, theyâ€™ll still appear in recipe viewers, which will confuse the players. Using `.*` at the start of the path helps exclude both the blend type and its associated recipe. 
</Callout>

### Removing All Existing Biome Blends

To block all blends under the `minecraft` namespace you can use additional pattern matching:
```json
  "filter": {
    "block": [
      {
        "namespace": "minecraft",
        "path": ".*blend_type/.*"
      }
    ]
  }
```

This removes all vanilla biome blends and their recipes.

## Using KubeJS

With KubeJS, you can zip a data pack that only contains the `pack.mcmeta` file and place it inside `kubejs/data` folder. It will load automatically with the rest of your KubeJS scripts. Because of that, your changes will be applied to all existing and new worlds.

## Full example `pack.mcmeta`
```json
{
  "pack": {
    "pack_format": 15,
    "description": "Data pack that removes all default blends and their recipes"
  },
  "filter": {
    "block": [
      {
        "namespace": "minecraft",
        "path": ".*blend_type/.*"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
